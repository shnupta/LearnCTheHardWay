/*
In the next three Exercises you'll create a skeleton project directory to use in building your C programs later. This skeleton directory will be used in the rest of the book, and in this exercise I'll cover just the Makefile so you can understand it.

The purpose of this structure is to make it easy to build medium sized programs without having to resort to configure tools. If done right you can get very far with just GNU make and some small shell scripts.
