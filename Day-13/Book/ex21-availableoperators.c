/*
This is a comprehensive list of all the operators you have in t
he C language. In this list, I'm indicating the following:

(binary)
The operator has a left and right: X + Y.
(unary)
The operator is on its own: -X.
(prefix)
The operator comes before the variable: ++X.
(postfix)
Usually the same as the (prefix) version, but placing it

after gives it a different meaning: X++.

(ternary)
There's only one of these, so it's actually called the

ternary but it means "three operands": X ? Y : Z.

//MATH OPERATORS
/*
These are your basic math operations, plus I put () i
n with these since it calls a function and is close to a 
"math" operation.

()
Function call.
* (binary)
multiply.
/
divide.
+ (binary)
addition.
+ (unary)
positive number.
++ (postfix)
read, then increment.
++ (prefix)
increment, then read.
-- (postfix)
read, then decrement.
-- (prefix)
decrement, then read.
- (binary)
subtract.
- (unary)
negative number.
*/



//DATA OPERATORS
/*
These are used to access data in different ways and forms.

->
struct pointer access.
.
struct value access.
[]
Array index.
sizeof
size of a type or variable.
& (unary)
Address of.
* (unary)
Value of.
*/




//LOGIC OPERATORS
/*
These handle testing equality and inequality of variables.

!=
does not equal.
<
less than.
<=
less than or equal.
==
equal (not assignment).
>
greater than.
>=
greater than or equal.
*/




//BIT OPERATORS
/*
These are more advanced and for shifting and modifying the 
raw bits in integers.

& (binary)
Bitwise and.
<<
Shift left.
>>
Shift right.
^
bitwise xor (exclusive or).
|
bitwise or.
~
compliment (flips all the bits).
*/




//BOOLEAN OPERATORS
/*
Used in truth testing. Study the ternary operator carefully, 
it is very handy.

!
not.
&&
and.
||
or.
?:
Ternary truth test, read X ? Y : Z as "if X then Y else Z".
*/






//ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
/*
Compound assignment operators that assign a value, and/or perform 
an operation at the same time. Most of the above operations can also 
be combined into a compound assignment operator.

=
assign.
%=
modulus assign.
&=
bitwise and assign.
*=
multiply assign.
+=
plus assign.
-=
minus assign.
/=
divide assign.
<<=
shift left, assign.
>>=
shift right, assign.
^=
bitwise xor, assign.
|=
bitwise or, assign.
