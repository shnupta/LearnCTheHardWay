# LearnCTheHardWay
My path to learning C

I'm learning C with this website: http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/

Derek Banas C Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSaXCpKS395wbCcmsmgRea7

The way I am completing the book is by trying to code at least once a day for at least 30+ mins.
I will go at my own pace completing and redoing each exercize as I feel necessary.

- Day 1: 30/3/16 - Ex1 to Ex3
- Day 2: 31/3/16 - Ex4 to Ex10
- Day 3: 1/4/16 - Ex11 to Ex13
- Day 4: 2/4/16 - Ex14 - Ex15
- Day 5: 3/4/16 - Ex16 - Ex17
- Day 6: 4/4/16 - MY OWN STACK DATA STRUCTURE! :D
- Day 7: 5/4/16 - Ex18 (less time and harder excersizes = less excersizes / day)
- Day 8: 6/4/16 - Ex19
- Day 9: 7/4/16 - Ex20 and dbg.h (READ: videohelp.txt)
- Day 10: 8/4/16 - Video 4 
- Day 11: 9/4/16 - Ex21 and some videos (a lot to do here)
