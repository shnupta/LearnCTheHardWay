# LearnCTheHardWay
My path to learning C

I'm learning C with this website: http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/

Derek Banas C Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSaXCpKS395wbCcmsmgRea7

The way I am completing the book is by trying to code at least once a day for at least 30+ mins.
I will go at my own pace completing and redoing each exercize as I feel necessary.

- Day 1: 30/3/16 - Ex1 to Ex3
- Day 2: 31/3/16 - Ex4 to Ex10
- Day 3: 1/4/16 - Ex11 to Ex13
- Day 4: 2/4/16 - Ex14 - Ex15
- Day 5: 3/4/16 - Ex16 - Ex17
- Day 6: 4/4/16 - MY OWN STACK DATA STRUCTURE! :D
- Day 7: 5/4/16 - Ex18 (less time and harder excersizes = less excersizes / day)
- Day 8: 6/4/16 - Ex19
- Day 9: 7/4/16 - Ex20 and dbg.h (READ: videohelp.txt)
- Day 10: 8/4/16 - Video 4
- Day 11: 9/4/16 - Ex21 and some videos (a lot to do here)
- Day 12: 10/4/16 - Ex21, I'm going away for a week from tomorrow
- Day 13: 17/4/16 - Ex21 - Type Conversion, Type Sizes, Available Operators and Control Structures (and I'm back! see day-13/info.txt)
- Day 14: 18/4/16 - Ex22 :)
- Day 15: 21/4/16 - Ex23, slowing down now due to upcoming exams
- Day 16: 10/5/16 - Ex24
- Day 17: 12/5/16 - Ex25, exams finish in two weeks
- Day 18: 15/5/16 - Ex26 part 1, started Ex25 and will finish some more next time :)
- Day 19: 16/5/16 - Ex26 part 2, finished writing shell.c but im stuck on analysing some of the functions and how it works so I've posted on a forum and waiting for a reply.
- Day 20: 24/5/16 - Ex26 part 3, didn't have much time today. Finished adding comments on the db files
- Day 21: 25/5/16 - Ex26 part 4 (i guess), tried analysing some more but still stuck on Shell_exec function in shell.c, asked for help from author
- Day 22: 29/5/16 - Ex26 part 5
- Day 23: 30/5/16 - Ex26 part 6
- Day 24: 31/5/16 - Ex26 part 7, finished writing all source files and compiles, but error when installing - cannot cleanup before build
- Day 25: 4/6/16 - Ex26 part 8, fixing bugs, still unable to recognise how to handle file.
- Day 26: 7/6/16 - Ex26 done, I've finished it and completely checked my code? but doesn't work on what I've tested, Zed's fault maybe?
- Day 27: 12/6/16 - Ex27
- Day 28: 13/6/16 - Ex28
- Day 29: 15/5/16 - Ex29 - will do the extra credit next time
- Day 30: 19/6/16 - Ex29 extra credit - first part (need to do c-skeleton part)
- Day 31: 20/6/16 - Ex29 finished all extra credit
- Day 32: 22/6/16 - Ex30, started 30, bit late so will finish tomorrow probably
- Day 33: 23/6/16 - completed ex30 and ex31
- Day 34: 27/6/16 - completed ex32
- Day 35: 28/6/16 - started ex 33
