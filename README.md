# LearnCTheHardWay
My path to learning C

I'm learning C with this website: http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/

The way I am completing the book is by trying to code at least once a day for at least 30+ mins.
I will go at my own pace completing and redoing each excersize as I feel necessary.

- Day 1: 30/3/16 - Ex1 to Ex3
- Day 2: 31/3/16 - Ex4 to Ex10
- Day 3: 1/4/16 - Ex11 to Ex13
- Day 4: 2/4/16 - Ex14 - Ex15
- Day 5: 3/4/16 - Ex16 - Ex17
- Day 6: 4/4/16 - MY OWN STACK DATA STRUCTURE! :D
