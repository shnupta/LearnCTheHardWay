/*
This exercize requires about a week's worth of learning and
remembering the info listed at: c.earncodethehardway.org/bookex21.html

For each I need to explain it and then wrte a program to confirm what
I've researched. I happen to be going away to Spain next week so I'll
spend that time learning and thinking of program ideas and then (if I
don't comlpete them all before I leave) I'll write the programs when 
I'm back :)

Best get to it!
