I've decided that from now on I'm going to complete an excersize then find
the relevent video from Derek Banas on Youtube. I'm doing this as I feel that
the learn c the hard way book doesn't go into quite enough detail but
also I think I need to use the technique that I'm being taught more 
than just once to get the jist of it and remember all I can about it. I will
link the video I'm using to learn off of as well as the book excersize. The
source files for the book and the videos will be in seperate files to
organise it better.
